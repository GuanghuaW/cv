## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.kean.edu/academics/college-science-mathematics-and-technology/department-computer-science-and-technology) at [Kean University](https://www.kean.edu). 

My research centers on **Natural Language Processing**, with particular interests in **multi-document summarization, long document summarization, multimodal summarization, and the application of large language models in data science**. I aim to develop innovative approaches that make text data more understandable and actionable.

Before joining Kean University, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://cs.utdallas.edu/), where I worked under the mentorship of [Dr. Weili Wu](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/weiliwu). I also hold a Master’s degree from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) and a Bachelor’s degree from [Northeastern University in China](https://www.neu.edu.cn/).
