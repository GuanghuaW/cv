## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Kean University. My research centers on Natural Language Processing, with particular interests in multi-document summarization, long document summarization, multimodal summarization, and the application of large language models in data science. I aim to develop innovative approaches that make text data more understandable and actionable.

Before joining Kean University, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Weili Wu. I also hold a Master’s degree from Peking University and a Bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University in China.
